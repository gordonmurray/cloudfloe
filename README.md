# 🌊 Cloudfloe

**The fastest way to query your Iceberg data lake.**

Connect your Iceberg tables on S3, R2, or MinIO — run SQL instantly — no clusters, no ops, no setup.

---

## 🚀 Why Cloudfloe?

Data lakes are great. Iceberg is powerful.  
But the moment you want to actually **query your data**, things get complicated:

- Spin up Trino? Heavy, cluster-based, ops overhead.  
- Use Athena? Tied to AWS, slower feedback loop.  
- Run DuckDB locally? Works, but messy to share and repeat.  

**Cloudfloe is different**: it’s *DuckDB-as-a-service* for your Iceberg lake.  
- Runs queries **directly on your lake** (S3, R2, MinIO).  
- **No data migration** — we don’t own your data.  
- Start in **under 60 seconds** with nothing to install.  

Think of it as a **scratchpad for your data lake**: lightweight, neutral, instant.

## ✨ Features (MVP)

- 🔗 Connect to your Iceberg tables on AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, or MinIO.  
- 🖥️ Run SQL queries in the browser, powered by DuckDB under the hood.  
- ⚡ Instant results — no cluster spin-ups, no waiting.  
- 💾 Save and share queries with your team.  
- 💡 Cost insights: see how much data you scanned, before you blow your budget.

## 🧊 Who is Cloudfloe for?

- **Data Engineers** who need to *peek inside Iceberg tables fast* without setting up Trino/Athena.  
- **BI Developers** wiring up dashboards with Superset, Rill, or Evidence and need a reliable query scratchpad.  
- **FinOps teams** who want visibility into data scan costs.  

If you’ve ever said *“I just want to see my Iceberg data now”* → Cloudfloe is for you.  

---

## 🔮 Roadmap

Cloudfloe starts as an **Iceberg-first query scratchpad**, but it’s a gateway to more:

- 📊 One-click export to Rill, Evidence, Superset.  
- 🧩 Support for Delta Lake, Apache Paimon, and Hudi.  
- 🔐 Collaboration features (teams, role-based access).  
- 📈 Query caching & dashboards.  

---

## 🌍 Vision

Cloudfloe is the **neutral gateway to your data lake**.  
No vendor lock-in, no ops burden, no hidden costs. Just pure, simple SQL on your Iceberg tables.

Would you like me to also **draft a leaner GitHub-style tagline + description** (those two little bits that show up at the very top of a repo page) so it hooks people *before* they even scroll into the README?
