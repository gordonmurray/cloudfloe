Cloudfloe - the Switzerland of Iceberg queries: neutral, easy entry across S3, R2, MinIO, etc.

Cloudfloe is the fastest way to query your Iceberg data lake. No clusters, no migration, no overhead. Just connect your S3/R2 Iceberg table, run SQL in the browser, and share insights instantly. Where Trino is heavyweight and MotherDuck centralizes your data, Cloudfloe stays light, neutral, and close to your lake.

Cloudfloe has a spark to it. The concept is clean: make querying Iceberg lakes dead simple, without forcing people to wrangle their own Trino clusters or wring performance out of DIY DuckDB setups. Let’s pull it apart a bit:

**Strengths**

* **Focused entry point**: starting with Iceberg only is smart. Narrow scope, clear messaging. BI/DE folks drowning in lake formats will see “plug in Iceberg, get SQL results” as refreshing.
* **DuckDB as engine**: excellent choice for small-to-mid scale queries. Lightweight, high-performance, already well loved by the community.
* **Positioning**: there’s a gap between raw data lakes and the BI tools. If Cloudfloe is the “gateway layer” that makes Iceberg queryable without friction, that’s compelling.
* **Cool branding**: “Cloudfloe” feels modern and memorable, especially tied to Iceberg.

**Challenges / Gaps**

* **Data size limits**: DuckDB is fantastic, but it’s not going to replace Trino for petabyte-scale queries. You’ll need to make it crystal clear Cloudfloe is for exploration, prototyping, lightweight workloads—not full enterprise OLAP.
* **Query costs & infra**: spinning containers per query keeps things isolated, but could get expensive if usage spikes. Need to think about scheduling, caching, pooling, and result storage early.
* **Value prop vs DIY**: most DE/BI folks can already spin up DuckDB or Trino locally. The SaaS must offer obvious advantages: zero setup, collaboration, saved queries/dashboards, governance/logging, integrations. Otherwise it’s “DuckDB but in the cloud.”
* **Competition**: Starburst, Dremio, MotherDuck (DuckDB-as-a-service), and the big clouds themselves all sit near this space. Differentiation will hinge on “we’re the simplest path to query your Iceberg lake, no cluster setup needed.”
* **Vendor tie-in risk**: AWS and Cloudflare may themselves release “query-as-a-service” for Iceberg. If they do, Cloudfloe must compete on UX and neutrality across vendors.

**Opportunities**

* Be the Switzerland of Iceberg queries: neutral, easy entry across S3, R2, MinIO, etc.
* Offer caching + cost transparency: “your query scanned X GB, cost Y” → huge win for FinOps-minded users.
* Integration glue: one-click “pipe this into Rill/Evidence/Superset” would make BI developers grin.
* Roadmap can expand to support Paimon, Delta, Hudi later—then you become “the lake query front door.”

The killer question: *why Cloudfloe instead of running DuckDB locally?* If the answer is “because Cloudfloe adds collaboration, persistence, cost visibility, and makes Iceberg approachable in 2 minutes,” then you’ve got a wedge.

**Cloudfloe vs. Trino**

* Trino: great for huge clusters, production pipelines, enterprise-scale federated queries. But it’s heavy: JVMs, catalogs, workers, ops overhead.
* Cloudfloe: no cluster, no ops. Just connect your Iceberg lake, run SQL, get results. Perfect for exploration, prototyping, and ad-hoc analysis.

Think of it as: Trino is the freight train, Cloudfloe is the nimble speedboat.

**Cloudfloe vs. MotherDuck**

* MotherDuck: DuckDB-in-the-cloud, but you move your data to them. Strong if you want SaaS DuckDB as your main warehouse.
* Cloudfloe: doesn’t own your data, it runs against your Iceberg lake where it lives (S3, R2, MinIO). Lightweight, neutral, no lock-in.

Think of it as: MotherDuck is a hosted kitchen, Cloudfloe is a chef who cooks at your house.

You don’t want to be “all of BI for Iceberg” out of the gate. You want one crisp, painful problem that Cloudfloe solves better than anything else.

Here are a few that fit your positioning:

1. “I just want to see my Iceberg data now.”

Pain: A data engineer sets up Iceberg tables in AWS or Cloudflare but has no easy way to immediately inspect what’s inside without spinning up Trino or Athena.

Wedge: Cloudfloe lets them paste connection details, run SQL, and see rows in under 60 seconds.

Why sticky: This becomes their go-to scratchpad for ad-hoc validation and debugging.

2. “Quick validation before wiring BI tools.”

Pain: BI devs wiring up Superset/Rill/Evidence need to test queries and schemas on the lake first. Doing that with Trino/Athena is slow and bureaucratic.

Wedge: Cloudfloe is the disposable, always-available query sandbox that lives between raw Iceberg and the BI tool.

Why sticky: Users keep coming back because it saves them setup time every time they onboard a new dataset.

3. “FinOps lens for Iceberg queries.”

Pain: Lakes hide costs. Queries can explode bills if you don’t know how much data you’re scanning.

Wedge: Every query Cloudfloe runs tells you: rows scanned, data size, approximate cost on AWS/Cloudflare.

Why sticky: FinOps is hot. Teams want visibility before they commit to expensive BI dashboards.

If I were you, I’d start with #1: the scratchpad. It’s the lightest to build, resonates with your target crowd, and gives you a natural on-ramp to add collaboration, caching, cost insights, and BI integration later.
